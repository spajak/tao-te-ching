    <p>Here, for the words in the third verse that I render “what it wants,” I use the <cite>Ma wang tui</cite> text. The words in the standard text mean boundaries, or limits, or outcomes. This version seems to follow more comprehensibly from the preceding lines.</p>
    <p>And yet the idea of what can be delimited or made manifest is relevant. In the last verse, the two “whose identity is mystery” may be understood to be the hidden, the unnameable, the limitless vision of the freed soul—and the manifest, the nameable, the field of vision limited by our wants. But the endlessness of all that is, and the limitation of mortal bodily life, are the same, and their sameness is the key to the door.</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-05">
    <p>As I said above, in a few of the poems I leave out lines which I find weaken the coherence of the text to the point that I believe them to be a long-ago reader’s marginal notes which got incorporated in later copyings. My authority for these omissions is strictly personal and aesthetic. Here I omit the last two lines. Translations of them vary greatly; my version is:</p>
    <p class="stanza">
        <span>Mere talk runs dry.</span>
        <span>Best keep to the center.</span>
    </p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-12">
    <p>There are times Lao Tzu sounds very like Henry David Thoreau, but Lao Tzu was kinder. When Thoreau says to distrust any enterprise that requires new clothes, I distrust him. He is macho, flaunting his asceticism. Lao Tzu knows that getting all entangled with the external keeps us from the eternal, but (see chapter 80) he also understands that sometimes people like to get dressed up.</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-13">
    <p><i>T’ien hsia</i>, “under heaven,” <i>i.e.</i> the Empire, or the world: here I render it as “the public good,” “the commonwealth,” and “the body politic.”</p>
    <p>J. P. Seaton comments: “When Lao Tzu mentions ‘the Empire’ or ‘all under heaven,’ he does so with the assumption that all his readers know that it is a commonwealth where only the ruler who rules by virtue of virtue alone is legitimate.”</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-17" title="17, 18, 19">
    <p>Henricks considers these three chapters (17, 18, 19) to belong together. The last two lines of 19 are usually printed as the first two lines of 20, but Henricks thinks they belong here, and I follow him.</p>
    <p>In 18, line 6, the words <i>hsiao tzu</i> are traditionally translated as “filial piety and paternal affection,” a Confucian ideal. In that chapter Lao Tzu cites these dutiful families as a symptom of social disorder. But in chapter 19, line 4, <i>hsiao tzu</i> appears as the good that will result when people cease being moralistic. Unable to reconcile these contradictory usages, and feeling that Lao Tzu was far more likely to use Confucian language satirically than straightforwardly, I fudged the translation in chapter 19, calling it “family feeling.” Evidently we aren’t the only society or generation to puzzle over what a family is and ought to be.</p>
    <p>Sometimes I translate the characters <i>su</i> and <i>p’u</i> with such words as <i>simple, natural</i>. Though the phrase “the uncarved block” has become familiar to many, yet metaphor may distance ideas and weaken a direct statement. But sometimes, as here, I use the traditional metaphors, because the context so clearly implies knowing something as an artist knows her materials, keeping hold on something solid.</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-20">
    <p>The standard texts ask what’s the difference between <i>wei</i> and <i>o</i>, which might be translated “yes” and “yessir.” The <cite>Ma wang tui</cite> has <i>wei</i> and <i>ho</i>: “yes” and “no.” This is parallel with the next line (“good and bad” in the standard text, “beautiful and ugly” in the <cite>Ma wang tui</cite>). Here’s a case where the older text surely is correct, the later ones corrupt.</p>
    <p>In the first two lines of the second verse, the <cite>Ma wang tui</cite> text is perfectly clear: “A person whom everyone fears ought to be feared.” The standard text is strange, obscure: “What the people fear must be feared.” Yet the next lines follow from it as they don’t from the <cite>Ma wang tui</cite>; and after much pondering I followed the standard text.</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-23">
    <p>In the second verse the word <i>shih</i>, “loss,” gives trouble to all the translators. Waley calls it “the reverse of the power” and “inefficacy,” and Waley’s interpretations are never to be ignored. All the same, I decided to take it not as the opposite of the Way and the power, but as a kind of shadow-Way. Identify yourself with loss, failure, the obscure, the unpossessible, and you’ll be at home even there.</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-24">
    <p>My version of the first four lines of the second verse doesn’t follow any of the scholarly translations, and is quite unjustified, but at least, unlike them, it makes sense without horrible verbal contortions.</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-25">
    <p>In all the texts, the fourth verse reads:</p>
    <p class="stanza">
        <span>So they say: “The Way is great,</span>
        <span>heaven is great,</span>
        <span>earth is great,</span>
        <span>and the king is great.</span>
        <span>Four greatnesses in the world,</span>
        <span>and the king is one of them.”</span>
    </p>
    <p>Yet in the next verse, which is the same series in reverse order, instead of “the king” it’s “the people” or “humanity.” I think a Confucian copyist slipped the king in. The king garbles the sense of the poem and goes against the spirit of the book. I dethroned him.</p>
    <p>The last words of the chapter, <i>tzu jan</i>, which I render “what is,” bear many interpretations. Waley translates them as “the Self-So,” glossing them as “the unconditioned” or “what is so of itself”; Henricks, “what is so on its own”; Lau, “that which is naturally so”; Gibbs-Cheng, “Nature”; Feng-English, “what is natural”; Lafargue, “things as they are.” I came out closest to Lafargue in this case.</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-26">
    <p>I follow the <cite>Ma wang tui</cite> text for the third verse, which fits the theme much better than the non-sequitur standard text, “Amid fine sights they sit calm and aloof.” The syntax of the <cite>Ma wang tui</cite> also clarifies the last verse, relating it to the last verse of chapter 13.</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-27">
    <p>The first two lines of the third verse say that the not-good are the <i>t’zu</i>: “the capital” (Carus), or “the charge” (Feng-English), or “the stock in trade” (Waley), or “the raw material” (Henricks) of the good. Lafargue has “the less excellent are material for the excellent,” and Gibbs-Cheng, “mediocre people have the potential to be good people.” The latter two interpretations seemed the most useful to me. And so I call these makings, this raw material, “a student”—somebody learning to be or know better.</p>
    <p>The last lines of the second and third verses are translated in wildly various ways; my “hidden light” and “deep mystery” are justified if, as I believe, Lao Tzu is signaling that his apparently simple statements have complex implications and need thinking about. Of course, this is true of everything in the book.</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-28">
    <p>“The natural” and “natural wood” are the same word, <i>p’u</i>, which I talked about in the note to chapter 19. Given the amount of cutting up and carving that goes on in the last verse (which seems a kind of footnote to the first three), we really seem to be talking about wood.</p>
    <p>Chinese lends itself to puns, and this last verse is rife with them. Waley says that <i>ch’i</i> (“useful things”) can mean “vessels” or “vassals,” and <i>chih</i> can mean “carving” or “governing.” A great government wouldn’t chop and hack at human nature, trying to make leaders out of sow’s ears. But the paradox of the last two lines surely exceeds any single interpretation.</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-29">
    <p>The phrase <i>t’ien hsia</i> occurs only in the first verse, where I translate it “the world.” I begin the second verse with the literal translation of it, “under heaven.” I wanted the phrase in the poem as a reminder that the world of these extremes—of hot and cold, weakness and strength, gain and loss—is the sacred object, the place under heaven.</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-31">
    <p>I have omitted certain lines included by the translators who are my sources and guides. In all the texts, the second verse begins:</p>
    <p class="stanza">
        <span>A courteous person</span>
        <span>in peacetime honors the left,</span>
        <span>in wartime, the right.</span>
    </p>
    <p>And the last verse begins:</p>
    <p class="stanza">
        <span>In celebrations the left is the place of honor,</span>
        <span>in mourning the right is the place of honor:</span>
        <span>so lesser officers stand on the left,</span>
        <span>the generalissimo on the right,</span>
        <span>just as they would at a funeral.</span>
    </p>
    <p>I consider these passages to be commentaries or marginal glosses that got copied into the text. J. P. Seaton says, “What were once supports by analogy to common ceremonial practice are now relevant only to the historian.” Here they confuse the clear, powerful statement that culminates in the last four lines. The confusion already existed when the <cite>Ma wang tui</cite> version was written, and there seems to be no way of sorting it out now except by radical surgery.</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-33">
    <p>This chapter sounds like Polonius, incontrovertible but banal, until the last verse, which is a doozer. Here are some other versions of the last six words, <i>Sss erh pu wang che shou</i>:</p>
    <div class="stanza">
        <p>Carus (word for word): “[Who] dies / yet / not / perishes, / the-one / islong-lived [immortal].”</p>
        <p>Carus’s free translation: “One who may die but does not perish has life everlasting.”</p>
        <p>Waley: “When one dies one is not lost; there is no other longevity.”</p>
        <p>Feng-English: “To die but not to perish is to be eternally present.”</p>
        <p>Henricks: “To die but not be forgotten—that’s [true] long life.”</p>
        <p>Bynner: “Vitality cleaves to the marrow / Leaving death behind.”</p>
        <p>Lafargue: “One who dies and does not perish is truly long-lived.”</p>
        <p>Gibbs-Cheng: “One who dies yet still remains has longevity.”</p>
        <p>Lau: “He who lives out his days has had a long life.”</p>
    </div>
    <p>Under J. P. Seaton’s guidance I finally came to feel that I had a handle on the line, and that Lau’s rendition was the most useful. One thing is certain, Lao Tzu is not saying that immortality or even longevity is desirable. The religion called Taoism has spent much imagination on ways to prolong life interminably or gain immortality, and the mythologized Lao Tzu was supposed to have run Methuselah a close race; but the Lao Tzu who wrote this had no truck with such notions.</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-36">
    <p><i>Wei ming</i>—this phrase in the first line of the second verse (and the chapter title)—is tricky:</p>
    <div class="stanza">
        <p>Carus (word for word): “the secret’s / explanation”;</p>
        <p>Carus’s free translation: “explanation [<i>i.e.</i>, enlightenment] of the secret”</p>
        <p>Feng-English: “perception of the nature of things”</p>
        <p>Gibbs-Cheng: “wonderfully minute and obscure, yet brilliant”</p>
        <p>Lafargue: “subtle clarity”</p>
        <p>Henricks: “subtle light”</p>
        <p>Bynner: “a man with insight”</p>
        <p>Waley: “dimming one’s light”</p>
    </div>
    <p><i>Ming</i> is “light” or “enlightenment.” Waley explains that <i>wei</i> means obscure because very small, and also obscure because dark. I use this second meaning to make an oxymoron.</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-37">
    <p>The words in the first verse I translate as “the nameless, the natural” and in the next verse as “the unnamed, the unshapen” are the same four words: <i>wu ming chih p’u</i>; more literally, “the naturalness of the unnamed.” “The unnamed” is a key phrase in the first chapter and elsewhere, as is “not wanting,” “unwanting.” <i>P’u</i> is the natural, the uncut wood, or, as Waley glosses it here, “uncarvedwood quality.”</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-38">
    <p>The series here is of familiar Confucian principles: <i>jen, li, i</i>—“good, humane, human-hearted, altruistic”; “righteous, moral, ethical”; “laws, rites, rules, law and order.” But Lao Tzu reverses and subverts the Confucian priorities.</p>
    <p><i>Chien shih</i> in the fourth verse is “premature knowledge” in Carus and “foreknowledge” in Lau, Henricks, and Waley (who explains it as part of Confucian doctrine). Henricks interprets it as having “one’s mind made up before one enters a new situation about what is ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ and ‘proper’ and ‘acceptable’ and so on.” Prejudice, that is, or opinion. Buddhists and Taoists agree in having a very low opinion of opinion.</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-39">
    <p><i>Yi</i>, “one, the one, unity, singleness, integrity,” is here translated as “whole, wholeness.”</p>
    <p>Waley explains the last two verses as comments on the first three, but their relevance is pretty tenuous. The last verse is very difficult and the translations are various and ingenious. Henricks reads the <cite>Ma wang tui</cite> text of the first two lines of it as meaning “too many carriages is the same as no carriage,” and I picked up on the idea of multiplicity as opposed to the singleness or wholeness spoken of in the first verses. The meaning of the lines about jade seems to be anybody’s guess.</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-41">
    <p>I moved the line about perfect whiteness down to keep the three lines about power together, in parallel structure with the three lines about the Way. In the last line of the second verse (and in chapters 21 and 35) I translate <i>hsiang</i> as “thought.” The word connotes “form, shape, image, idea” Waley explains it as the form which is formless, the Tao which can’t be tao’d.</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-42">
    <p>In the sixth line, does the word <i>fu</i> mean “carry on one’s back” or “turn one’s back on”? Lafargue is the only translator I found that made the second choice. I don’t follow him because I don’t think the “ten thousand things” would or can make the mistake of turning their backs on the yin to embrace only yang. (But a great many of us do make that mistake, which is why Lao Tzu keeps reminding us to value yin, the soft, the dark, the weak, earth, water, the Mother, the Valley.)</p>
    <p>Lafargue’s reading, however, lets the next stanza follow more coherently— orphans, the bereaved, the outcast are what we turn our backs on; winning is yang, losing is yin. Through loss we win…</p>
    <p>The last stanza is uncharacteristic in its didactic tone and in assimilating the teaching to a tradition. Lao Tzu usually cites “what others teach” only to dissociate himself from it. I was inclined to dismiss it as a marginal note by someone who was teaching and annotating the text. But J. P. Seaton, who does teach the text, persuaded me to keep it in the body of the poem, saying, “It’s a message that for all its flat moralism does connect Taoism to Confucianism and even to Buddhism with a single solid thread—averting a hundred holy wars, if nothing else.”</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-44">
    <p>The intense, succinct, beautiful language of the first verses of a poem is sometimes followed by a verse or two in a more didactic tone, smaller in scope, and far more prosaic. I believe some of these verses are additions, comments, and examples, copied into the manuscripts so long ago that they became holy writ. They usually have their own charm and validity, but—as here, and in chapter 39 and other places—they bring a tremendous statement down to a rather commonplace ending. But then, Lao Tzu values the commonplace.</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-47">
    <p>The last line, literally “not do, yet accomplish,” is a direct statement of one of the fundamental themes of the book. When I came up with a slightly mealy version of it (“doesn’t do, but it’s done”) J. P. Seaton reminded me that “doing without doing is doing, not not doing.”</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-48">
    <p><i>Shi</i> (my “fuss,” Carus’s “diplomacy”) is translated by Lafargue as “work,” by Lau as “meddling,” by Waley and Feng-English as “interference,” by Henricks as “concern,” by Gibbs-Cheng as “act for gain.”</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-49">
    <p>Following some of Carus’s interpretations, the first lines of the third verse might be read, “Wise souls live in the world carefully, handling it carefully, making their mind universal.” I can’t make much sense of any of the other versions except Henricks’s beautiful reading:</p>
    <p class="stanza">
        <span>As for the Sage’s presence in the world, he is one with it.</span>
        <span>And with the world he merges his mind.</span>
    </p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-50">
    <p>Those who read <i>shih yu san</i> as “thirteen,” rather than as “three out of ten,” make better sense of the difficult first verse. The thirteen “companions of life” (Waley, Henricks), which I translate “organs,” may be physical, the limbs and passages and cavities of the body—or physio/psychological, the emotions and sensations.</p>
    <p>My “mad bull” occurs variously as a rhinoceros and a wild buffalo. The idea seems to be a big irritable animal with horns.</p>
    <p>My “live in the right way” is literally “take care of your life,” or “hold on to your life.” The context indicates care without anxiety, holding without grasping. I read the poem as saying that if you can take life as it comes, it doesn’t come at you as your enemy. Lao Tzu’s “nowhere for death to enter” isn’t a promise of invulnerability or immortality; his concern is how to live rightly, how to “live till you die.”</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-52">
    <p>The last two lines of the first verse are the same as the last two lines of chapter 16. I wonder if some of these repetitions were insertions by people studying and copying the book, who were reminded of one poem by another and noted down the relevant lines. They are indeed relevant here, but they don’t fit with perfect inevitability, as they do in chapter 16. This is of course a purely aesthetic judgment, subject to destruction by scholarship at any moment.</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-54">
    <p>Gibbs and Cheng, finding both the language and the message “discordant with the teachings of Lao Tzu,” won’t even discuss this chapter. Waley’s reading saves it, but the listing “self, family, community, country, empire/world” (a conventional series in ancient Chinese thought), and the list of rules and results is uncharacteristically mechanical. Though he uses many commonplaces, familiar phrases, rhymed sayings, and so on, Lao Tzu’s thought and language are usually more unconventional and unpredictable than this.</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-56">
    <p>Another repetition: the first four lines of the second verse are the same as the second verse of chapter 4. They carry a different weight here. I vary my translation of them in the fourth line to make it connect to the next.</p>
    <p><i>Hsuan t’ung</i>, “the deep sameness”: <i>hsuan</i> is “deep” or “mysterious”; <i>t’ung</i> is variously translated “identification,” “oneness,” “sameness,” “merging,” “leveling,” “assimilation.” It is an important theme, met with before in chapter 49.</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-57">
    <p>The phrase “How do I know? By this,” has become a kind of tag by its third repetition; but as Waley points out, it still implies intuitive knowing, beyond reason—knowing the way.</p>
    <p>The words I translate “experts” literally mean “sharp weapons,” but the term implies “pundits, know-it-alls.” I was tempted to say “smart bombs,” which is too cute and topical, but which would certainly lead neatly to the next lines.</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-58">
    <p>Waley points out that words in the last verse, with such meanings as “square, right, angular,” are typical Confucian virtues. Henricks remarks that all these words and operations refer to carpentry. The verse is about how to cut the uncut wood without cutting it.</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-59">
    <p><i>Se</i>, my “gather spirit,” is variously translated “frugality,” “moderation,” “restraint,” “being sparing,” or, by Waley, “laying up a store.” Evidently the core idea is that of saving.</p>
    <p>The chapter is usually presented in the manual-for-princes mode. Waley makes sense out of it by complex technical references; other versions make only gleams of sense. To persuade or coerce it into the personal mode meant a more radical interpretation than I usually dare attempt, but Waley’s reading, which points to the symbology of the breath (<i>ch’i</i>) and the “long look” of the meditator, gave me the courage to try. Here is a version closer to the conventional ones:</p>
    <p class="stanza">
        <span>In controlling people and serving heaven</span>
        <span>it’s best to go easy.</span>
        <span>Going easy from the start</span>
        <span>is to gather power from the start,</span>
        <span>and gathered power keeps you safe.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="stanza">
        <span>Safe, you can do what you like.</span>
        <span>Do what you like, the country’s yours.</span>
        <span>If you can make the country’s</span>
        <span>Mother yours, you’ll last a long time.</span>
        <span>You’ll have deep roots and a strong trunk.</span>
        <span>The way to live long is to look long.</span>
    </p>

    <p>The first seven lines continue the themes of “sameness” or assimilation, and of “being woman,” “being water,” the uses of yin. From there on, the language goes flat, and may be interpolated commentary. There’s an even feebler fourth verse:</p>
    <p class="stanza">
        <span>A big country needs more people,</span>
        <span>A small one needs more room.</span>
        <span>Each can get what it needs,</span>
        <span>but the big one needs to lie low.</span>
    </p>
    <p>Because the <cite>Ma wang tui</cite> texts are older, one longs to see them as more authentic, less corrupt. But though they are invaluable in offering variant readings, some of the variants may themselves be corruptions. In this chapter, the <cite>Ma wang tui</cite> reads “Small countries, submitting to a great one, are dominated,” and in the next verse, “Some by lying low stay on top, but some by lying low stay on the bottom.” Both versions are truisms, but the <cite>Ma wang tui</cite> version isn’t even a Taoistic truism.</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-62">
    <p>The first and last verses hang together; the two middle verses are difficult and rather incoherent. Waley says the enigmatic second verse refers to sophists and sages who went about selling their “fine words” to the highest bidder, like our pop gurus and TV pundits.</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-64">
    <p>I think the advice about being careful at the end of an undertaking was added, perhaps to balance the advice that the right time to act is before the beginning. It confuses the argument a bit, and I put it in parentheses.</p>
    <p>The line I give as “turn back to what people overlooked” is rendered by Lafargue as “turns back to the place all others have gone on from”; FengEnglish, “brings men back to what they have lost”; Henricks, “returns to what the masses have passed by”; Waley, “turning all men back to the things they have left behind.” Each version brings out a different color in the line, like different lights on an opal.</p>

    <p>A dictator and his censors might all too easily cite from this chapter. A democrat might agree that the more people know, the harder they are for a ruler to govern—since the more they know, the better they are at governing themselves. Anyone might agree that an intellectual agenda pursued without reality-checking is indeed a curse upon the land. From the divine right of kings through the deadly teachings of Hitler and Mao to the mumbojumbo of economists, government by theory has done endless ill. But why is Lao Tzu’s alternative to it a people kept in ignorance? What kind of ignorance? Ignorance of what? Lao Tzu may be signalling us to ask such questions when he speaks of “understanding these things.”</p>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-69">
    <p>Waley is my guide to the interpretation of the second verse, but I make very free with the last two lines of it. If they aren’t a rather vapid statement that one should never underestimate one’s foe, they must follow from what went before and lead to the extraordinary last verse. It all comes down to the last line and the word <i>shwai</i>. Carus translates it as “the weaker [the more compassionate],” and Bynner uses the word “compassion.” Waley translates it as “he who does not delight in war,” Henricks as “the one who feels grief,” Gibbs-Cheng as “the one stung by grief,” Feng-English as “the underdog,” Lafargue as “the one in mourning.” A man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-71">
    <p>I follow Henricks in choosing the <cite>Ma wang tui</cite> text, which has a double negative in the second line. Most other texts have “not knowing knowing is sickness.”</p>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-72">
    <p>I take the liberty of reading this chapter as a description of what we, we ordinary people, should fear. The usual reading is in the manual-for-princes mode. In that case “what should be feared” is the ruler, the rightful authority, and the advice that follows is evidently directed to that ruler. It’s certainly what William Blake would have told the oligarchs of the Industrial Revolution, who still control our lives:</p>
    <p class="stanza">
        <span>When people don’t fear what should be feared</span>
        <span>they are in fearful danger.</span>
        <span>Don’t make them live in narrow houses,</span>
        <span>don’t force them to do stupid work.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="stanza">
        <span>When they’re not made stupid</span>
        <span>they won’t act stupidly.</span>
    </p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-74">
    <p>I follow the <cite>Ma wang tui</cite> text, but make very free with the word Henricks renders as “constant [in their behavior].” If I understand Henricks’ version, it says that if people were consistent in behaving normally and in fearing death, and if death were the penalty for abnormal behavior, nobody would dare behave abnormally; and so there would be no executions and no executioners. But this is not the case; as Lao Tzu says, there are times when even normal people lose their normal fear of death. So what is the poem about? I read it as saying that since we are inconsistent both in our behavior and in our fear of death, no person can rightfully take on the role of executioner, and should leave the death penalty to the judgment of heaven or nature.</p>

    <p>To dismiss this Utopia as simply regressivist or anti-technological is to miss an interesting point. These people have labor-saving machinery, ships and land vehicles, weapons of offense and defense. They “have them and don’t use them.” I interpret: they aren’t used by them. We’re used, our lives shaped and controlled, by our machines, cars, planes, weaponry, bulldozers, computers. These Taoists don’t surrender their power to their creations.</p>
    <p>The eleventh line, however, is certainly regressive if it says knotted cords are to replace written literature, history, mathematics, and so on. It might be read as saying it’s best not to externalize all our thinking and remembering (as we do in writing and reading), but to keep it embodied, to think and remember with our bodies as well as our verbalizing brains.</p>
</div>

<div epub:type="endnote" id="en-81">
    <p>This last poem is self-reflexive, wrapping it all up tight in the first verse, then opening out again to praise the undestructive, uncompetitive generosity of the spirit that walks on the Way.</p>
    <p>To my mind, the best reason for following the <cite>Ma wang tui</cite> text in reversing the order of the books is that the whole thing ends with a chapter (37) that provides a nobler conclusion than this one. But if you reverse the order, chapter 1 turns up in the middle of the book, and I simply cannot believe that that’s right. That poem is a beginning. It is the beginning.</p>

<section epub:type="introduction">
    <p>The <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite> was probably written about twenty-five hundred years ago, perhaps by a man called Lao Tzu, who may have lived at about the same time as Confucius. Nothing about it is certain except that it’s Chinese, and very old, and speaks to people everywhere as if it had been written yesterday.</p>
    <p>The first <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite> I ever saw was the Paul Carus edition of 1898, bound in yellow cloth stamped with blue and red Chinese designs and characters. It was a venerable object of mystery, which I soon investigated, and found more fascinating inside than out. The book was my father’s; he read in it often. Once I saw him making notes from it and asked what he was doing. He said he was marking which chapters he’d like to have read at his funeral. We did read those chapters at his memorial service.</p>
    <p>I have the book, now ninety-eight years old and further ornamented with red binding-tape to hold the back on, and have marked which chapters I’d like to have read at my funeral. In the Notes, I explain why I was so lucky to discover Lao Tzu in that particular edition. Here I will only say that I was lucky to discover him so young, so that I could live with his book my whole life long.</p>
    <p>I also discuss other aspects of my version in the Notes—the how of it. Here I want to state very briefly the why of it.</p>
    <p>The <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite> is partly in prose, partly in verse; but as we define poetry now, not by rhyme and meter but as a patterned intensity of language, the whole thing is poetry. I wanted to catch that poetry, its terse, strange beauty. Most translations have caught meanings in their net, but prosily, letting the beauty slip through. And in poetry, beauty is no ornament; it is the meaning. It is the truth. We have that on good authority.</p>
    <p>Scholarly translations of the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite> as a manual for rulers use a vocabulary that emphasizes the uniqueness of the Taoist “sage,” his masculinity, his authority. This language is perpetuated, and degraded, in most popular versions. I wanted a Book of the Way accessible to a present-day, unwise, unpowerful, and perhaps unmale reader, not seeking esoteric secrets, but listening for a voice that speaks to the soul. I would like that reader to see why people have loved the book for twenty-five hundred years.</p>
    <p>It is the most lovable of all the great religious texts, funny, keen, kind, modest, indestructibly outrageous, and inexhaustibly refreshing. Of all the deep springs, this is the purest water. To me, it is also the deepest spring.</p>

    <p>This is a rendition, not a translation. I do not know any Chinese. I could approach the text at all only because Paul Carus, in his 1898 translation of the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite>, printed the Chinese text with each character followed by a transliteration and a translation. My gratitude to him is unending.</p>
    <p>To have the text thus made accessible was not only to have a Rosetta Stone for the book itself, but also to have a touchstone for comparing other English translations one with another. If I could focus on which word the translators were interpreting, I could begin to understand why they made the choice they did. I could compare various interpretations and see why they varied so tremendously; could see how much explanation, sometimes how much bias, was included in the translation; could discover for myself that several English meanings might lead me back to the same Chinese word. And, finally, for all my ignorance of the language, I could gain an intuition of the style, the gait and cadence, of the original, necessary to my ear and conscience if I was to try to reproduce it in English.</p>
    <p>Without the access to the text that the Carus edition gave me, I would have been defeated by the differences among the translations, and could never have thought of following them as guides towards a version of my own. As it was, working from Carus’s text, I learned how to let them lead me into it, always using their knowledge, their scholarship, their decisions, as my light in darkness.</p>
    <p>When you try to follow the Way, even if you wander off it all the time, good things happen though you do not deserve them. My work on the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite> was very wandering indeed. I started in my twenties with a few chapters. Every decade or so I’d do another bit, and tell myself I’d sit down and really get to it, some day. The undeserved good thing that happened was that a true and genuine scholar of ancient Chinese and of Lao Tzu, Dr. J. P. Seaton of the University of North Carolina, saw some of my versions of bits of the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite> (scurvily quoted without attribution by myself). He reprinted them with honor, and asked me for more. I do not think he knew what he was getting into. Of his invaluable teaching, his encouragement, his generosity, I can say only what Lao Tzu says at the end of the book:</p>
    <p class="stanza">
        <span>Wise souls don’t hoard;</span>
        <span>the more they do for others the more they have,</span>
        <span>the more they give the richer they are.</span>

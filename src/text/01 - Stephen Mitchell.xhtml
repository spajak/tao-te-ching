    <p>Describing the indescribable, teaching the unteachable, pointing the way to the Way—what does Lao-tzu think he is doing here? It can’t be done. No way.</p>
    <p>Hence Po Chü-i, poet and stand-up comedian, wrote,</p>
    <blockquote>
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>“He who talks doesn’t know,</p>
            <p>he who knows doesn’t talk”:</p>
            <p>that is what Lao-tzu told us,</p>
            <p>in a book of five thousand words.</p>
            <p>If he was the one who knew,</p>
            <p>how could he have been such a blabbermouth?</p>
        </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>That’s the problem with spiritual teachers. They <em>have</em> to be blabbermouths. But their words are (in the traditional Buddhist metaphor) fingers pointing at the moon; if you watch the finger, you can’t see the moon. How meticulous the great Masters had to be!</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>A monk asked Ma-tsu, “Why do you teach, ‘Mind is Buddha’?”</p>
        <p>Ma-tsu said, “To stop a baby from crying.”</p>
        <p>The monk said, “When the crying has stopped, what then?”</p>
        <p>Ma-tsu said, “Then I teach, ‘Not mind, not Buddha.’”</p>
        <p>The monk said, “How about someone who isn’t attached to either?”</p>
        <p>Ma-tsu said, “I would tell him, ‘Not beings.’”</p>
        <p>The monk said, “And what if you met a man unattached to all things: what would you tell <em>him</em>?”</p>
        <p>Ma-tsu said, “I would just let him experience the great Tao.”</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In fact, the truth is right before our eyes; right under our noses; so simple that every child understands it; and yet, as Bankei said, the farther you enter into it, the deeper it is. Where is the way to the Way? What a question!</p>
    <p>Still, for complicated minds, drastic measures are needed. Lao-tzu’s book was written as a response, out of grandmotherly kindness. According to the oldest biography,</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Lao-tzu lived for a long time in the country of Chou, but seeing its decline he departed. When he reached the frontier, the guard said, “Since you are going away, Sir, could you write a book to teach me the art of living?” Thereupon Lao-tzu wrote his book about the Tao, and departed.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This is legend, but it is an accurate description of the way in which true teaching happens. He who knows doesn’t talk, but words are no hindrance for him. He uses them as he would use gardening tools. When someone asks, he answers.</p>
    <p><em>The tao that can be told / is not the eternal Tao</em>: The text reads, “The tao that can be tao-ed [one meaning of <em>tao</em> being ‘to express’] / is not the eternal Tao.” Other possible renderings: “The way that can be weighed / is not the eternal Way,” “The force that can be forced / is not the eternal Force.”</p>
    <p><em>you realize the mystery</em>: Infinitely marvelous, yet as ordinary as sunlight. Impossible to know, yet as easy as touching your nose when you wash your face.</p>
    <p><em>This source is called darkness</em>: Because none of our senses can perceive it. It is also called “light,” because the less we obstruct it, the more radiant we are.</p>
    <p><em>The gateway to all understanding</em>: In order to understand, we have to remain in the darkness of not-knowing.</p>
</aside>

<aside epub:type="footnote" id="fn-02">
    <p><em>acts without doing anything</em>: Her actions are appropriate responses. Thus they are effortless. She embodies compassion, yet she doesn’t try to be compassionate. She doesn’t struggle to make money, yet she enjoys spending it when it comes to her. She goes her own way, yet she accepts help gratefully and has no pride in walking alone. She is not elated by praise, not discouraged by neglect. She doesn’t give even a moment’s thought to right or wrong. She never has to make a decision; decisions arise by themselves. She is like an actress who loves her role. The Tao is writing the script.</p>
    <p><em>teaches without saying anything</em>: The way she buys oranges or ties her shoelaces is a teaching. Her face is more eloquent than any scripture could be.</p>
    <p><em>That is why it lasts forever</em>: Not in time and space, but in quality.</p>

    <p><em>emptying people’s minds</em>: He empties them of concepts, judgments, and desires. Thus they can return to a state of childlike simplicity.</p>
    <p><em>filling their cores</em>: He fills them with a sense of their original identity. Thus they can return to a state of joy.</p>
    <p><em>weakening their ambition</em>: When they have no false self to nourish or defend, they find that greed, hatred, and arrogance vanish by themselves.</p>
    <p><em>toughening their resolve</em>: Their innermost intention. They develop enough self-reliance to give up the idea of self.</p>

    <p>Following Ch’en Ku-ying, I have deleted the second stanza of the Chinese text, which seems to be an interpolation from chapter 56.</p>
    <p><em>It is older than God</em>: There is no God when there is nothing <em>but</em> God.</p>
</aside>

<aside epub:type="footnote" id="fn-05">
    <p><em>The Tao doesn’t take sides; / it gives birth to both good and evil</em>: Literally, “Heaven and earth are impartial; they treat all things like straw dogs,” as the Master “treats all people like straw dogs,” Straw dogs were ritual objects, venerated before the ceremony but afterward abandoned and trampled underfoot. The point here is not that the Tao is cruel to things, nor that the Master is ruthless with people, but that they are impartial. The Master sees all beings arising from the same source, working out their karma (usually with great suffering), and returning to the source. And since people are in constant flux, she understands that at any moment they are capable of the most astonishing spiritual transformations. Why should she pin them motionless with a judgment of “good” or “bad”?</p>
</aside>

<aside epub:type="footnote" id="fn-06">
    <p>First stanza: Literally, “The spirit of the valley never dies. It is called the mysterious female. The gate of the mysterious female is the root of heaven and earth.” Chu Hsi said, “The female is one who receives something and, with it, creates. This creative principle is the most marvelous thing in the universe.”</p>

<aside epub:type="footnote" id="fn-07">
    <p><em>The Tao is infinite, eternal</em>: Here is everywhere. Anytime is now.</p>
    <p><em>The Master stays behind; that is why she is ahead</em>: She is like a turtle: wherever she is, is home. Actually, she is neither behind nor ahead, but exactly even with all things.</p>
    <p><em>She is detached</em>: Bunan said, “It is easy to keep things at a distance; it is hard to be naturally beyond them.” Detachment results in clarity; clarity expresses itself in love. Her heart is like a mirror, which reflects all faces, without judgment, exactly as they are.</p>

    <p><em>The supreme good is like water</em>: I asked my friend and teacher Emilie Conrad-Da’oud, founder of Continuum, to comment on this verse. She said,</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Water is the source of all life, life’s matrix and fecundity; it overflows into everything, it moves everywhere. We are fundamentally water: muscled water. And the idea that we ever leave the amniotic fluid is a misconception. The amniotic fluid is the state of total nourishment and unconditional love. It is always present for us and contains everything we could possibly want. In fact, we <em>are</em> that fluid of love.</p>

    <p><em>supple as a newborn child’s</em>: Emilie Conrad-Da’oud’s comment:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>There is no self-consciousness in the newborn child. Later on, the mind wanders into self-images, starts to think <em>Should I do this? Is this movement right</em>? and loses the immediacy of the moment. As self-consciousness develops, the muscles become less supple, less like the world. But the young child is pure fluidity. It isn’t aware of any separation, so all its movements are spontaneous and alive and whole and perfect.</p>
    <p>If an adult body becomes truly supple, though, there’s a quality to its movement that the child’s doesn’t have, a texture of experience, a fourth dimension of time. When we watch a seventy-year-old hand move, we feel, “Yes, that hand has lived.” All the bodies it has touched, all the weights it has lifted, all the heads it has cradled are present in its movement. It is resonant with experience; the fingers curve with a sense of having been there. Whereas in a child’s hand there’s a sense of just arriving. The child’s movement is pristine and innocent and delightful, but a truly supple adult movement is awesome, because all life is included in it.</p>

We think that there is something hiding our reality and that this must be destroyed before reality is gained. How ridiculous! A day will dawn when you will laugh at all your past efforts.

    <p><em>Can you love people and lead them / without imposing your will</em>: Emilie Conrad-Da’oud’s comment:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The more supple your body is, the less dictatorial you’ll be. The military stance is the most invasive stance that you can possibly take. Its opposite—the boneless, wishy-washy posture of someone who doesn’t stand for anything—is just as unhealthy. Suppleness is really fluidity. It transcends strength and weakness. When your body is supple, it feels like there’s no barrier in you, you can flow in any direction, your movement is a complete expression of yourself.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The mind is originally empty, and only when it remains empty, without grasping or rejecting, can it respond to natural things, without prejudice. It should be like a river gorge with a swan flying overhead; the river has no desire to retain the swan, yet the swan’s passage is traced by its shadow, without any omission. Another example: A mirror will reflect all things perfectly, whether they are beautiful or ugly; it never refuses to show a thing, nor does it retain the thing after it is gone. The mind should be as open as this.</p>

    <p>There are a number of passages in the Tao Te Ching where a much narrower consciousness is at work than in the rest of the book.

Because they live life too intensely. I have heard that he who knows how to preserve his life meets neither rhinoceros nor tiger when he travels by land, and is untouched by the sword when he enters a battle. The rhinoceros finds no place in him to drive its horn; the tiger finds no place in him to sink its claws; the soldier finds no place in him to thrust his sword. Why is this?

I have no complaint whatsoever.’” The man did as he was instructed, for a whole year, but his heart was still not at peace. He returned to Sono, crestfallen. “I’ve said your prayer over and over, and yet nothing in my life has changed; I’m still the same selfish person as before.

A small country by being in a lower position can conquer a large country. Therefore the one conquers by placing itself lower, the other conquers by being naturally lower. A large country wants nothing more than to gather people and nourish them. A small country wants nothing more than to enter and serve the people. Since both get what they want, the large country should take the lower position.</p>

    <p>Second stanza: I have improvised here. The text reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>I have three treasures which I preserve and treasure. The first is compassion, the second is frugality, the third is daring not to be first in the world. Whoever has compassion can be brave. Whoever has frugality can be generous. Whoever dares not to be first in the world can become the leader of the world. But to be brave without compassion, generous without frugality, prominent without humility: this is fatal. Whoever shows compassion in battle will conquer. Whoever shows compassion in defense will stand firm. Heaven helps and protects those with compassion.</p>

The farmer’s son spent much of his time riding them; one day he fell off and broke his hipbone. All his neighbors offered the farmer their condolences, but his father said, “How do you know that this isn’t good fortune?” Another year passed, and the barbarians invaded the frontier. All the able-bodied young men were conscripted, and nine-tenths of them died in the war. Thus good fortune can be disaster and vice versa. Who can tell how events will be transformed?</p>

<section epub:type="foreword" id="foreword">
    <p><em>Tao Te Ching</em> (pronounced, more or less, <em>Dow Deh Jing</em>) can be translated as <em>The Book of the Immanence of the Way</em> or <em>The Book of the Way and of How It Manifests Itself in the World</em> or, simply, <em>The Book of the Way</em>. Since it is already well known by its Chinese title, I have let that stand.</p>
    <p>About Lao-tzu, its author, there is practically nothing to be said. He may have been an older contemporary of Confucius (551-479 B.C.E.) and may have held the position of archive-keeper in one of the petty kingdoms of the time. But all the information that has come down to us is highly suspect. Even the meaning of his name is uncertain (the most likely interpretations: “the Old Master” or, more picturesquely, “the Old Boy”). Like an Iroquois woodsman, he left no traces. All he left us is his book: the classic manual on the art of living, written in style of gemlike lucidity, radiant with humor and grace and largeheartedness and deep wisdom: one of the wonders of the world.</p>
    <p>People usually think of Lao-tzu as a hermit, a dropout from society, dwelling serenely in some mountain hut, unvisited except perhaps by the occasional traveler arriving from a ’60s joke to ask, “What is the meaning of life?” But it’s clear from his teachings that he deeply cared about society, if society means the welfare of one’s fellow human beings; his book is, among other things, a treatise on the art of government, whether of a country or of a child. The misperception may arise from his insistence on <em>wei wu wei</em>, literally “doing not-doing,” which has been seen as passivity. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
    <p>A good athlete can enter a state of body-awareness in which the right stroke or the right movement happens by itself, effortlessly, without any interference of the conscious will. This is a paradigm for non-action: the purest and most effective form of action. The game plays the game; the poem writes the poem; we can’t tell the dancer from the dance.</p>
    <div class="stanza">
        <p>Less and less do you need to force things,</p>
        <p>until finally you arrive at non-action.</p>
        <p>When nothing is done,</p>
        <p>nothing is left undone.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Nothing is done because the doer has wholeheartedly vanished into the deed; the fuel has been completely transformed into flame. This “nothing” is, in fact, everything. It happens when we trust the intelligence of the universe in the same way that an athlete or a dancer trusts the superior intelligence of the body. Hence Lao-tzu’s emphasis on softness. Softness means the opposite of rigidity, and is synonymous with suppleness, adaptability, endurance. Anyone who has seen a t’ai chi or aikido master doing not-doing will know how powerful this softness is.</p>
    <p>Lao-tzu’s central figure is a man or woman whose life is in perfect harmony with the way things are. This is not an idea; it is a reality; I have seen it. The Master has mastered Nature; not in the sense of conquering it, but of becoming it. In surrendering to the Tao, in giving up all concepts, judgments, and desires, her mind has grown naturally compassionate. She finds deep in her own experience the central truths of the art of living, which are paradoxical only on the surface: that the more truly solitary we are, the more compassionate we can be; the more we let go of what we love, the more present our love becomes; the clearer our insight into what is beyond good and evil, the more we can embody the good. Until finally she is able to say, in all humility, “I am the Tao, the Truth, the Life.”</p>
    <p>The teaching of the Tao Te Ching is moral in the deepest sense. Unencumbered by any concept of sin, the Master doesn’t see evil as a force to resist, but simply as an opaqueness, a state of self-absorption which is in disharmony with the universal process, so that, as with a dirty window, the light can’t shine through. This freedom from moral categories allows him his great compassion for the wicked and the selfish.</p>
    <div class="stanza">
        <p>Thus the Master is available to all people</p>
        <p>and doesn’t reject anyone.</p>
        <p>He is ready to use all situations</p>
        <p>and doesn’t waste anything.</p>
        <p>This is called embodying the light.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
        <p>What is a good man but a bad man’s teacher?</p>
        <p>What is a bad man but a good man’s job?</p>
        <p>If you don’t understand this, you will get lost,</p>
        <p>however intelligent you are.</p>
        <p>It is the great secret.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The reader will notice that in the many passages where Lao-tzu describes the Master, I have used the pronoun “she” at least as often as “he.” The Chinese language doesn’t make this kind of distinction; in English we have to choose. But since we are all, potentially, the Master (since the Master is, essentially, us), I felt it would be untrue to present a male archetype, as other versions have, ironically, done. Ironically, because of all the great world religions the teaching of Lao-tzu is by far the most female. Of course, you should feel free, throughout the book, to substitute “he” for “she” or vice versa.</p>
    <p>As to method: I worked from Paul Carus’s literal version, which provides English equivalents (often very quaint ones) alongside each of the Chinese ideograms. I also consulted dozens of translations into English, German, and French. But the most essential preparation for my work was a fourteen-year-long course of Zen training, which brought me face to face with Lao-tzu and his true disciples and heirs, the early Chinese Zen Masters.</p>
    <p>With great poetry, the freest translation is sometimes the most faithful. “We must try its effect as an English poem,” Dr. Johnson said; “that is the way to judge of the merit of a translation.” I have often been fairly literal—or as literal as one <em>can</em> be with such a subtle, kaleidoscopic book as the Tao Te Ching. But I have also paraphrased, expanded, contracted, interpreted, worked with the text, played with it, until it became embodied in a language that felt genuine to me. If I haven’t always translated Lao-tzu’s words, my intention has always been to translate his mind.</p>

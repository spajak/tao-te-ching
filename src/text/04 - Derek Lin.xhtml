    <h4>01</h4>
    <div epub:type="footnote" id="fn-01-1">
        <p><span class="noteref">1</span> The first line of the Tao Te Ching can be one of the most confusing. Some have interpreted it to mean that we must never speak of the Tao, or that if we try to explain it, then we must have no true understanding of it.</p>
        <p>What it actually means is that we can never understand the Tao through the intellect alone. We must feel it. Talking about it can be useful but will never replace the actual experience of living it. <a epub:type="backlink" href="#nr-01-1">↩</a></p>
    </div>
    <div epub:type="footnote" id="fn-01-2">
        <p><span class="noteref">2</span> Not only is the Tao beyond the power of spoken words to describe, but it is also beyond the power of written words to define. That which can be defined is limited by the definition, and the Tao transcends all limitations. <a epub:type="backlink" href="#nr-01-2">↩</a></p>
    </div>
    <div epub:type="footnote" id="fn-01-3">
        <p><span class="noteref">3</span> Before the universe came into being, concepts and things did not exist, and no human consciousness was present to perceive and name them. Therefore, the Tao that initiated Creation was the ultimate nameless enigma. <a epub:type="backlink" href="#nr-01-3">↩</a></p>
    </div>
    <div epub:type="footnote" id="fn-01-4">
        <p><span class="noteref">4</span> Once the universe came into being, the stage was set for the physical manifestation of everything, including human beings. These humans eventually attained sufficient awareness to observe all things and name them. <a epub:type="backlink" href="#nr-01-4">↩</a></p>
    </div>
    <div epub:type="footnote" id="fn-01-5">
        <p><span class="noteref">5</span> Self-serving desires tend to limit us to a superficial level. If we think of other people and not just focus on ourselves, we will find it much easier to connect with the underlying reality. This applies to every aspect of life. It is one of the most powerful teachings of the Tao. <a epub:type="backlink" href="#nr-01-5">↩</a></p>
    </div>
    <div epub:type="footnote" id="fn-01-6">
        <p><span class="noteref">6</span> The two refer to manifestations (outer appearance) and essence (inner truth). They represent the material world and the spiritual realm respectively. Both emerge from the Tao, because the Tao encompasses all—not only spirituality but also the physical universe. The basic unity of the two is the mystery that we investigate in Tao cultivation. <a epub:type="backlink" href="#nr-01-6">↩</a></p>
    </div>
    <h4>02</h4>
    <div epub:type="footnote" id="fn-02-1">
        <p><span class="noteref">1</span> Tao sages have long recognized the relative nature of the world. Values have meaning only in comparison. For instance, a task can only be “easy” if we compare it to some other task that is more difficult. If there is nothing else to compare it with, the task cannot be rated in terms of difficulty. <a epub:type="backlink" href="#nr-02-1">↩</a></p>
    </div>
    <div epub:type="footnote" id="fn-02-2">
        <p><span class="noteref">2</span> Similarly, we can only say an object is “long” if we are comparing it to another similar object that is shorter. Each half of a duality cannot exist without the other. A descriptive concept creates its own opposite. This relative concept applies to everything, even good and evil.</p>
        <p>What about absolute good and evil? Do they exist in the Tao? While we can certainly find absolutes in abstract theory, in the real world they rarely, if ever, exist. For instance, no metal is absolutely free of impurities. In fact, hardly anything in nature is absolutely pure. We can get close to 100 percent purity but never quite reach that absolute state.</p>
        <p>It is the same with people. Absolute good and evil can exist as concepts, but we will never find them in human beings. We are all mixtures of varying proportions. None of us is any one thing. <a epub:type="backlink" href="#nr-02-2">↩</a></p>
    </div>
    <h4>03</h4>
    <div epub:type="footnote" id="fn-03-1">
        <p><span class="noteref">1</span> When we glorify achievers and set them aside for special treatment, people will compete aggressively and step over one another to achieve that glory. Similarly, when we place a high value on certain goods, there will be those who plot to take them by force or by trickery.</p>
        <p>This determination of value can be rather arbitrary. For instance, what intrinsic goodness does gold have that makes it so much more valuable than other metals? What is so great about gold other than a particular numerical value that people determine and agree upon? In general, whenever we point to anything as desirable, a wave of disruption ripples through society. People begin to think of ways to get more of the desirable thing, often at the expense of others.</p>
        <p>Because of this, a sagacious ruler refrains from setting aside certain individuals for glorification, or designating certain goods as extremely valuable and putting them on display. These are surefire ways of stimulating materialistic desire, which is a bottomless pit. <a epub:type="backlink" href="#nr-03-1">↩</a></p>
    </div>
    <div epub:type="footnote" id="fn-03-2">
        <p><span class="noteref">2</span> Although the sages empty people’s hearts of desires and reduce their ambitions for fame, glory, or material wealth, they also pay particular attention to their basic needs. As rulers, the sages see to it that the people enjoy good health and do not go hungry. As teachers, the sages give people teachings that provide spiritual sustenance and promote spiritual health. <a epub:type="backlink" href="#nr-03-2">↩</a></p>
    </div>
    <div epub:type="footnote" id="fn-03-3">
        <p><span class="noteref">3</span> When people follow the way of the sages, the few who scheme and plot will find themselves unable to utilize their repertoire of clever ploys. The governance of the sages leaves no room for their contrived tactics, and everything falls into place peacefully and naturally. <a epub:type="backlink" href="#nr-03-3">↩</a></p>
    </div>
    <h4>04</h4>
    <div epub:type="footnote" id="fn-04-1">
        <p><span class="noteref">1</span> The emptiness of the Tao is not a vacuous state of nothingness, because its infinite depths conceal the seeds of Creation. There appears to be nothing in the Tao, and yet it contains everything. It is the “pregnant void,” a field of unlimited potentialities.</p>
        <p>One way to describe the Tao is to compare it with an empty container with infinite capacity. This container cannot be filled up, and the water that flows out of it can never be used up. It continues to function indefinitely. <a epub:type="backlink" href="#nr-04-1">↩</a></p>
    </div>
    <div epub:type="footnote" id="fn-04-2">
        <p><span class="noteref">2</span> The Tao is eternal. It outlasts everything. After millions of years, even the tallest, sharpest mountain peaks will be reduced to gentle rolling hills. After billions of years, even the brightest stars will burn out and shine no more.</p>
        <p>Given enough time, all problems great and small will be resolved one way or another, like the unraveling of even the tightest knots. Given enough time, even the proudest achievements of humankind will be reduced to dust. <a epub:type="backlink" href="#nr-04-2">↩</a></p>
    </div>
    <div epub:type="footnote" id="fn-04-3">
        <p><span class="noteref">3</span> The indistinct nature of the Tao refers to the fact that we cannot perceive it directly. We can only observe its effects on the world, just as we can see the effects of gravity (objects falling) but never gravity itself. <a epub:type="backlink" href="#nr-04-3">↩</a></p>
    </div>
    <div epub:type="footnote" id="fn-04-4">
        <p><span class="noteref">4</span> We do not know how the Tao came to be, or whether it came from anywhere at all. Does the concept of “place” have meaning without the Tao? Does the ultimate source have a source? We cannot say. We cannot pretend to have all the answers. <a epub:type="backlink" href="#nr-04-4">↩</a></p>
    </div>
    <div epub:type="footnote" id="fn-04-5">
        <p><span class="noteref">5</span> ”Emperor” in this line refers to <i>Yu Di</i>, the Jade Emperor. He is the ruler of the universe and the supreme deity in ancient Chinese mythology. Lao Tzu is saying that the image of the Tao precedes even such a being, because any principles that govern the divine must, by definition, be part of the Tao. Therefore, the Tao has to be <i>already present</i> before anything like a supreme deity can manifest existence. <a epub:type="backlink" href="#nr-04-5">↩</a></p>
    </div>
    <h4>05</h4>
    <div epub:type="footnote" id="fn-05-1">
        <p><span class="noteref">1</span> The original Chinese characters <i>bu ren</i> are often mistranslated as “ruthless” or “without compassion.” This produces statements at odds with reality, because real-life sages are compassionate individuals—hardly ruthless.</p>
        <p>The true meaning of <i>bu ren</i> is that the Tao does not play favorites. The rain waters weeds and orchids equally; the sun shines on everyone with the same brightness and warmth despite variations in individual merits. The sage, in emulating the Tao, also regards everyone in the same egalitarian light—none higher and none lower. <a epub:type="backlink" href="#nr-05-1">↩</a></p>
    </div>
    <div epub:type="footnote" id="fn-05-2">
        <p><span class="noteref">2</span> Straw dogs are literally small dog figurines made from straw. They were used in ancient times for rituals, and then discarded after use. It is a striking metaphor when we consider how we are similar to the straw dogs. We are here to go through the ritual called life; when the ritual is done there is no further use for the physical body, so it is discarded. <a epub:type="backlink" href="#nr-05-2">↩</a></p>
    </div>
    <div epub:type="footnote" id="fn-05-3">
        <p><span class="noteref">3</span> “Too many words” here means too much bureaucracy, or too many rules and regulations. <a epub:type="backlink" href="#nr-05-3">↩</a></p>
    </div>
    <div epub:type="footnote" id="fn-05-4">
        <p><span class="noteref">4</span> I have translated the last character, <i>zhong</i>, as “quiet.” This can be confusing even to native Chinese speakers. According to the dictionary, it means “middle” or “center.” Thus, one may assume the last line has to do with centering oneself or holding on to the principle of moderation. This is probably not correct, because the previous line is not about the danger of extremes.</p>
        <p>The real meaning of <i>zhong</i>, in ancient times and in this particular context, is silence. When we see how the maddening “noise” of complex bureaucracy and too many laws hasten failure, we would naturally want to reach for its opposite—the quietness of simplicity. <a epub:type="backlink" href="#nr-05-4">↩</a></p>
    </div>
    <h4>06</h4>
    <div epub:type="footnote" id="fn-06-1">
        <p><span class="noteref">1</span> The spirit of the valley is a powerful symbol for yin, the universal female principle. It is eternal; it has always existed and will always exist. This principle has many names. We can call it the sacred feminine, or the Mystic Female. <a epub:type="backlink" href="#nr-06-1">↩</a></p>
    </div>
    <div epub:type="footnote" id="fn-06-2">
        <p><span class="noteref">2</span> The Mystic Female is the ultimate source of all living things. The ancient Chinese noted that women were responsible for the miracle of life, and therefore had to possess a measure of divine power. They respected this power and regarded it as the basis of existence (the root of Heaven and Earth). <a epub:type="backlink" href="#nr-06-2">↩</a></p>
    </div>
    <div epub:type="footnote" id="fn-06-3">
        <p><span class="noteref">3</span> The essence of life itself is a continuous flow. We may take it for granted and not pay attention to it, but it is always there. Because life begets life, its power extends indefinitely into the future. It does not matter how much we utilize; we can never use it up.</p>
        <p>As Tao cultivators, we are in tune with this essence. We recognize the goddess in every woman and celebrate the sacred power of the feminine. Let us be mindful of the truth that we all come from the Mystic Female, without which none of us can exist. <a epub:type="backlink" href="#nr-06-3">↩</a></p>
    </div>
    <h4>07</h4>
    <div epub:type="footnote" id="fn-07-1">
        <p><span class="noteref">1</span> Heaven and Earth perform their functions without selfish desires. When we emulate this aspect of nature, we think of others first and ourselves last. By letting go of self-centered thoughts, we can feel the way our inner nature mirrors the greater Tao. When we let this natural mirroring process take place without interference, we become like Heaven and Earth—existing to be of service to others. <a epub:type="backlink" href="#nr-07-1">↩</a></p>
    </div>
    <div epub:type="footnote" id="fn-07-2">

It is the ancient Chinese way of telling a bookworm to “get a life.”</p>
        <p>Some people have such a powerful desire for ever more knowledge that they fail to hear this message. They interpret “end” to mean “extreme” or “ultimate”; they change the first line to say that if one could gain the ultimate knowledge so that there is nothing more to learn, then people would benefit a hundredfold.</p>
        <p>In this fashion, they have taken a warning against the blind pursuit of knowledge and transformed it into a rallying cry to acquire even more. The fact that this distortion can happen at all is the very reason Lao Tzu warns against it.</p>
        <p>As we cultivate the Tao, let us keep Lao Tzu’s admonition in mind. Knowledge isn’t a bad thing per se, but book smarts can never replace street smarts, and school learning can never compare to life learning. We need both.</p>
        <p>This is one of the most difficult chapters to understand, because we have a strong tendency to worship knowledge. We have all been conditioned to believe that knowledge is power, so how can having more be a bad thing? Lao Tzu is unique among all the ancient philosophers in consistently highlighting the pitfalls of knowledge. In several chapters, including this one, he points to the link between intelligence and arrogance. He also points to the ease with which we can use knowledge in a shrewd way to twist the truth. In fact, this very chapter provides an excellent example. <a epub:type="backlink" href="#nr-19-1">↩</a></p>

        <p>Tao cultivators do not take offense at this.

Their lives are limited, so we do not regard them with annoyance or indignation, only with compassion and goodwill.</p>
        <p>Sages liken such individuals to a frog who lives in a well. From its perspective at the bottom, the sky is rather small.

        <p>In this chapter, I translate the character <i>bing</i> as “fault” or “flaw.” Many translators translate it as “disease” or “illness” instead, which is the dictionary definition as well as the common usage, but in this case it doesn’t quite fit. When Lao Tzu uses <i>bing</i>, he is specifically referencing human errors and character flaws—being sick or defective in some aspect of one’s thinking. This context still exists in modern Chinese.

        <p>The Tao is silent, and yet instantaneously responsive. In the same way, we, too, can be quiet while remaining sensitive to external conditions. When things change, we are ready to alter our approach, quietly and efficiently.</p>

        <p>The concept of the “master executioner” in this chapter mirrors the “heavenly net” concept from the previous chapter. They are different ways of describing the same karmic mechanism that seems to pervade reality. <a epub:type="backlink" href="#nr-74-2">↩</a></p>

Trying to do so is similar to beginners trying to cut wood like an expert carpenter. When they fumble around with sharp tools, they are likely to accidentally cut themselves. Similarly, if we kill on behalf of the master executioner, we are likely to harm ourselves. In other words, a society that avidly supports capital punishment in a bloodthirsty way is not doing itself any favors.</p>
        <p>Aside from the observation that the death penalty doesn’t seem effective as a deterrent, we should also consider the possibility that innocents may be executed by mistake—and certainly those who are killed can no longer make amends and repay their debt to society.</p>
        <p>The central idea in this chapter is that the negative approach is rarely effective. Capital punishment does not necessarily improve society.

        <p>As the emperor of your own life, you have a responsibility to be a wise ruler. That means paying attention to your spiritual needs and simplifying your life.

        <p>Again, this Tao principle pervades all aspects of life. Therefore, companies that use high-pressure sales tactics will not end up with the most satisfied customers and repeat business. Similarly, if we apply pressure to others in an attempt to make them do what we want, we will end up with resentment and alienation.</p>
        <p>Smart companies apply no pressure. They provide attention, service, and assistance to customers, thus earning their trust, which can lead to repeat business and referrals.

The “left part” means the lender’s copy. It refers to the ancient Chinese method of keeping track of debts, which existed even before the invention of paper. Lender and borrower would take a piece of wood or tree bark and carve a record of their transaction on it. Then they would split it down the middle. The left part would go to the lender; the right to the borrower.</p>
        <p>The left part was the lender’s proof of his right to demand payments. When the loan was fully paid, the lender would give the left part to the borrower, thus making the contract whole.

<section epub:type="foreword">
    <h2 class="chapter">Foreword</h2>
    <p>The classic Tao Te Ching is, in my opinion, simply the wisest book ever written. I have read and reread it more than any other, and I have discovered that, unlike some of us, it only gets better and better with age. It reveals how both action and contemplation are paths to experiencing harmony, peace, and unity admidst diversity. It exemplifies both the Bodhisattva’s skillful means of <i>being there</i> while getting there, every single step of the way, and the sublime secret that is the inseparability of oneness and noneness. It is also the ultimate primer on <i>menschkeit</i>, the art of living as a mature person of integrity, expounding how to be a good citizen and impeccable leader, attain genuine excellence, and realize self-mastery.</p>
    <p>I first met the Tao Te Ching while in college in Buffalo, New York, during the tumultuous late 1960s. I was both enamored of the serene wisdom of this sublime text and mesmerized by its poetic brevity and tantalizing existential mystery. The morning after discovering the Tao Te Ching, I went straight to the bookstore and bought a copy, mulling over its cryptic verses day and night for weeks, finding it hard to go to class and endure academic lectures made pale by comparison. Over the years, some of my intrepid friends have even ventured to translate, or make versions of, the Tao Te Ching—a daunting task at best. As a Buddhist teacher, I often recommend the Tao Te Ching to my Dharma students to augment their spiritual studies and refine their sense of practice, of <i>presencing</i>.</p>
    <p>My oldest Chinese friend in Hong Kong, the master puppet maker and old school Shanghai Zen man we called Michael Lee, used to read me one poem every morning at dawn, upstairs in his Kowloon slum apartment. When he died, he left me a hand-calligraphed copy of one of his ancient, yellowed rice-paper manuscripts of the Chinese classic, which remains one of my prized Asian artifacts. Derek Lin’s fine new translation is as good as any and better than many, and his commentaries help illumine the text.</p>
    <p>Word has it that one day some disciples found the elder Taoist philosopher Chuang Tzu in front of his house, sitting peacefully on the ground in the sun with his fresh-washed long hair cascading down around him. The students gathered around him and waited patiently. “What are you doing, Master?” they finally asked. “Drying my hair in the sun,” the old sage replied. “Can we help you?” they wanted to know. “How can you help me; what is there that that needs to be done? My hair is being dried by the sun, and I am resting at the origin of all things.”</p>
    <p>This enigmatic story concerns the inner journey to the very center of things, beyond the dichotomy of doing and being and yet including both. The Taoist sages exemplify harmony and serenity, oneness, authenticity, and the spontaneous flow of naturalness. When nothing is done, nothing is left undone. That’s really somethin’, ain’t it?</p>
    <p>When I myself don’t know what to do, which is surprisingly often, I try to take the Tao Te Ching’s advice on the subject and do nothing, along the lines of the core Taoist notion of <i>wu wei</i>, which can be translated as “nonstriving.” Overdoing things has produced so much more harm than good in this busy world; I think we’d do well to learn how to undo the habit of overdoing. The nineteenth-century enlightened vagabond and Tibetan Dzogchen master Patrul Rinpoche sums it up like this: “Beyond action and inaction the sublime Dharma is accomplished.” This is the sublime peace of the Tao, something we can all experience by learning to live in the Tao through coming into accord with how things actually are—what Tibetan Buddhists call the natural state. Rather than trying to build skyscrapers to reach heaven and bridges to cross the raging river of samsara to reach the so-called other shore of nirvana, we could realize that it all flows right through us right now and there’s nowhere to go, nothing to get, and all is perfect as it is. This deep inner knowing has a lot to do with trust and letting be; there is nirvanic peace in things just as they are.</p>
    <p>This should not be misconstrued as a rationalization for mere quietism, cold indifference, passivity, or dropping out. Five hundred years before Jesus, Taoists taught passive resistance, a crucial element of world-changing modern spiritual activists such as Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and the Dalai Lama of Tibet. The ancient masters revealed how to be steadfast and supple, like water—flowing rather than fixed, rigid, or static—which is of great benefit, for water is stronger than even stone: water’s constant flow will eventually wear anything down and carry everything away. Like the underlying continuum of reality, the great Tao is groundless and boundless; it is flowing, dynamic, yet unmoved amidst infinite change. “Yield and overcome, and you cannot be broken,” they taught. “Bend and be straight.” These are powerful words, truth spoken to power. Wisdom is as wisdom <i>does</i>. Awakening oneself awakens the whole world.</p>
    <p>A little Tao goes a long way. The Tao Te Ching should be savored leaf by leaf, line by line, like haiku poetry—read and enjoyed, pondered, and reread again. These finely wrought, provocative, ultimate utterances are chock full of one-sentence sermons encapsulating universal wisdom in a charming, poetic form that leaves room for more interpretation than a Rorschach inkblot. Here we can find evocative pearls of wisdom concerning the mysteries of yin and yang and the manner in which the great Middle Way balances, harmonizes, and reconciles primordial dichotomies such as light and dark, heaven and earth, good and evil, man and woman, doing and being, life and death. These sublime little sutras have edified, instructed, encouraged, and entertained millions of people for millennia, and they continue to do so today. Like a veritable treasure trove, this masterful book of wise living and authentic being provides both spiritual sustenance and practical guidance, so necessary for us today and tomorrow.</p>
    <p>The Tao Te Ching teaches that ruling an empire is like frying small fish. Think about that for a moment: Frying small fish takes a lot of care and trouble, yet is rewarded with little benefit. Studying the Tao Te Ching, however, is quite the opposite: Any effort invested in penetrating the subtle beauty and mystery of this ancient wisdom classic will be rewarded in abundance, as it has for generations.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Some time ago, Amazon.com asked author Michael Crichton the following question: “If you were stranded on a desert island with only one book, which book would it be?”</p>
    <p>His answer: the Tao Te Ching.</p>
    <p>Why? With millions of books from which to choose, including the greatest literature human civilization has ever produced, why the Tao Te Ching?</p>
    <p>Crichton is not the only famous author with such a high regard for this ancient classic. Eckhart Tolle calls it one of the most profound spiritual books ever written. What is it about the Tao Te Ching that inspires such praise? What accounts for its appeal?</p>
    <p>The Tao Te Ching ranks with the Bible as one of the most translated books of all time. This is all the more amazing when you consider that it achieves this status without the active promotion of religious institutions. Its widespread popularity throughout history is due to its own merits. Yet, at first glance, the Tao Te Ching may not seem very remarkable. It is a thin book; its eighty-one chapters are so concise that most of them do not fill an entire page. Somehow, its succinct words manage to convey a universe of wisdom and insight. Of all the great works of spirituality in human history, the Tao Te Ching may be the one that <i>says the most with the least</i>.</p>
    <p>The richness of the Tao Te Ching invites—even demands—lifelong exploration. Its layers of meaning reveal themselves gradually. No matter how many times we study it, we discover something new with each reading. People who return to the Tao Te Ching after a hiatus often find that it seems like a completely different book. Even though its words remain the same, people change, and their additional life experience allows them to see new lessons that had been there all along but had gone unnoticed—lessons hidden in plain sight.</p>
    <p>The Tao Te Ching presents its teachings without fanfare. Its author, Lao Tzu, does not claim divine inspiration, infallibility, or indeed any basis of authority. He is a mere philosopher, not a prophet or messiah. He does not ask us to accept anything on blind faith, but rather trusts that the lessons in the Tao Te Ching will prove themselves.</p>
    <p>For these lessons are eminently practical. The Tao Te Ching is more than a commentary on spirituality; it is also a useful and down-to-earth guide to living life with grace, peace, and joy. Perhaps this, more than any other reason, is why the Tao Te Ching has cast its spell on generation after generation since its writing 2,500 years ago.</p>
    <h4>Birth of the Tao Te Ching</h4>
    <p>But just what is the Tao Te Ching? How was it written? And who exactly was its author, Lao Tzu? Taoist lore includes a legendary story about the origin of the Tao Te Ching that, like all good stories, reveals more than it first appears.</p>
    <p>The events in the story took place during the decline of the Zhou Dynasty. The emperor had lost effective control, and noble families ruling individual states seized power, each hoping to consolidate China under its own rule. This was the precursor to the time of unrest in Chinese history known as the Warring States period.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>It was a typical day at the Hangu Pass, with no more than the usual number of people leaving or entering the Zhou State. Yin Xi [pronounced <i>Yin Shi</i>], the Commander of the Pass, looked over the travelers with watchful eyes. Recent news of impending war gave him ample reason to be especially alert.</p>
        <p>He saw an old man riding an ox and approaching slowly. Yin Xi sensed something different about this man. He trusted his intuition, so he walked up and asked, “What is your name?”</p>
        <p>Unlike many Yin Xi had encountered before, the old man had a perfectly composed demeanor, neither pompous nor ingratiating. “I am Li Er,” he replied.</p>
        <p>The name was familiar. Yin Xi searched his memory and suddenly realized what his intuition was trying to tell him. “Are you not the one they call Lao Tzu, the Old Master?”</p>
        <p>The old man’s expression showed a flicker of reluctance, for he had no wish to draw attention. He nodded and answered, “Indeed.”</p>
        <p>“This is a great honor,” Yin Xi said, bowing deeply. “I am an avid student of the Tao, and people say you teach the Tao with divine powers.”</p>
        <p>Lao Tzu smiled and said, “Let us not be too hasty in believing what people say, Commander.”</p>
        <p>“You must have tea with me before resuming your journey,” Yin Xi said. “I absolutely insist.” Lao Tzu saw the sincerity in Yin Xi’s invitation and gladly accepted.</p>
        <p>The Commander ordered his men to maintain vigilance and led Lao Tzu into his office. “Master, I am most curious about how you gained your legendary wisdom,” Yin Xi said as he boiled water for tea.</p>
        <p>“I claim no wisdom whatsoever. Others may get that impression only because I have served as King Wu’s Royal Archivist over the years.”</p>
        <p>“Yes, it is said you won the position due to your ability to remember and summarize all the books you read. You must possess extraordinary knowledge,” said Yin Xi.</p>
        <p>“The Tao is about returning to simplicity, not pursuing knowledge. While there are certainly many books in the archives, by themselves they are powerless to capture the essence of the Tao.”</p>
        <p>“I find it difficult to imagine all those books in one place. Only a king can amass such a collection. I consider myself lucky to even see one book; a library is almost beyond my comprehension.”</p>
        <p>“Books are dead things, Commander,” said Lao Tzu. “They contain the words of people long gone. The only way to gain living wisdom from dead books is by applying their words to life.”</p>
        <p>“True. Nevertheless, I suspect there are many scholars who desire your unlimited access to the books for themselves. Surely they wish to oust you in order to take over your position?” asked Yin Xi.</p>
        <p>“Yes. The position may seem prestigious, but in fact it can be dangerous as well. Many people would use unscrupulous means, even violence, to take the position for themselves. Serving the king can also be dangerous—he has been known to execute his own advisors because they made some careless mistake.”</p>
        <p>“And yet you have survived and thrived as Royal Archivist for years. What is your secret?” Yin Xi asked eagerly as he poured tea into two cups.</p>
        <p>“There is no secret. I use the Tao. Anyone can do the same thing—avoid danger and enjoy peace—through diligent cultivation of the Tao.”</p>
        <p>“In that case, you should be able to maintain your position for many years to come.”</p>
        <p>“No. My work for His Majesty is done,” answered Lao Tzu. “I am able to retire. With the clouds of war hanging over the land, I see no reason to remain.”</p>
        <p>“How I envy your freedom! I hear about the impending war and think about going away myself, but I am tied to my property and career.”</p>
        <p>“Such is the nature of desires and attachments. That which you desire tends to bind you; relinquishing or reducing the desire tends to free you.” Lao Tzu sat back and sipped his tea.</p>
        <p>“It is a pity that you are leaving, Master, for I and many others can learn much from you,” said Yin Xi. “Would you consider writing down some notes for us, so we can cultivate the Tao on our own?”</p>
        <p>“That is an excellent idea,” said Lao Tzu. “Let me write down the basic concepts, the standard sayings, and summaries of the major works in the Royal Archives. I will also include advice I have given King Wu over the years, for it too is based on the Tao.”</p>
        <p>“Would such advice apply to me, Master?”</p>
        <p>“Certainly. The scope may change but the Tao remains constant no matter who you are. Royalty or commoner—it makes no difference to the Tao.”</p>
        <p>Lao Tzu began working. He leveraged his prodigious memory and understanding to create one concise chapter after another. Each chapter was a highly refined distillation of a major principle, a notable book, or a discussion with the king.</p>
        <p>Finally, it was done. Lao Tzu gave Yin Xi the manuscript. Yin Xi could not believe it. What he held in his hands was King Wu’s private library condensed into a compact form. He felt as if Lao Tzu had squeezed all the treasures in the royal vault into a diamond and handed it over to him.</p>
        <p>Lao Tzu said his farewell, mounted the ox and continued on his way. Yin Xi called out after him, “Master! How can I thank you for this gift? Will I ever see you again?”</p>
        <p>Lao Tzu smiled back at him and answered, “This gift is a dead thing, too. In that respect it is no different from other books. Remember: you can make it come alive by putting what it says into actual practice. When you do so, you will see me … in the Tao.”</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Yin Xi looked on as Lao Tzu receded from view. Neither one of them realized that the gift was destined to become a spiritual cornerstone, not just for the Chinese but for all humankind. Neither one realized that one of the most significant events in human history had just taken place. This typical day at the Hangu Pass … turned out to be not so typical after all.</p>
    <h4>The Origin of the Tao</h4>
    <p>This story of Lao Tzu at the pass is both memorable and useful for clearing up a number of points about the Tao and Taoism. Perhaps the most common misconception encountered by Westerners is that Lao Tzu himself was the founder of Taoism—which he was not. By the time Lao Tzu walked the Earth 2,500 years ago, the concept of the Tao had already been an integral part of Chinese culture for thousands of years. As the story puts it, Lao Tzu was looking to get away, not found a movement; by writing the Tao Te Ching, he was simply honoring a request to pass on the learning and knowledge of those who had preceded him.</p>
    <p>The Tao Te Ching itself contains references to “ancient masters” or “masters of antiquity,” terms referring not to Lao Tzu’s contemporaries, as we may at first assume, but rather to people who were as ancient to him as he is to us. Two such ancient masters were Huang Ti (Pinyin <i>Huangdi</i>) and Fu Hsi (Pinyin <i>Fuxi; </i>pronounced <i>Fu Shi</i>). They were among the earliest rulers of China who lived more than 4,700 years ago—at least 2,200 years before Lao Tzu. Huang Ti has always been closely associated with the early form of Taoism, and Fu Hsi was the originator of the yin-and-yang concept.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, it is interesting to note that Lao Tzu did not intend to write an expression of original ideas. Instead, he summarized existing ideas and teachings to create an overview of prevailing concepts. We know from Chinese oral tradition that one of Lao Tzu’s primary sources was the library of King Wu. Although this library had an impressive collection, it still did not possess every notable book known to the ancients at that time—after all, King Wu was not the emperor of China, but only one of many lords vying for that title. Therefore, Lao Tzu’s overview was almost comprehensive, but not quite.</p>
    <p>In time, other sages of ancient China understood what Lao Tzu was trying to accomplish, and over the next seven centuries they added to his work wherever they noticed gaps. This gave rise to the historically verifiable fact that multiple early versions of the Tao Te Ching existed. Each was a work in progress as the sages who came after Lao Tzu changed a few words and shifted the order of the chapters. This process continued until about 1,800 years ago, when noted scholar Wang Bi consolidated the myriad editing changes and finalized the compilation.</p>
    <p>These multiple versions of the Tao Te Ching have led some modern-day scholars to theorize that perhaps “Lao Tzu” is a composite of multiple individuals and never existed as a single historical figure.</p>
    <p>People may assume that the question of Lao Tzu’s historical existence must be as important to Taoists as Jesus’ historical existence is to Christians, but it is not. Students of the Tao follow principles rather than particular individuals. The message is the central thing; the messenger is merely the conduit. Thus, the issue of historicity does not in the least diminish the importance of the Tao Te Ching or the power of its teachings.</p>
    <p>Lao Tzu had created something so accessible that subsequent philosophers built on it and developed what we now know as Philosophical Taoism, characterized by its secular observation of the natural laws governing existence. At the same time, spiritual seekers built on it in a different way to create Religious Taoism, marked by doctrines, rituals, and a pantheon of deities. Lao Tzu can be properly credited as the one who started these two parallel threads that became mainstays of Chinese culture. At the same time, the original form of Taoism that inspired him should also be recognized as the true source.</p>
    <p>The incredibly ancient history of the Tao means that we can use the Tao Te Ching as a gateway to the distant past. When we study and practice it, we are not only bringing these words to life in our present circumstances, we are also leveraging Lao Tzu’s words from 2,500 years ago to vault further back in time. Through Lao Tzu, we are extending our reach all the way to antiquity and connecting with the essence of the Chinese spirit since time immemorial.</p>
    <h4>Interfaith Approach</h4>
    <p>One reason Taoism has such durability is, paradoxically, because of its flexible and inclusive nature. Upon hearing it for the first time, many people assume the word <i>Tao</i> to be a specialized term specific to Taoism. In Chinese culture, however, it has always been a generic term applicable to every aspect of life, including <i>every conceivable religion</i>, because every belief system has its own particular way. The ancient Chinese sages who originated the term were perhaps the first practitioners of the interfaith approach to spirituality. Following their lead, Chinese people throughout history have applied the term to every school of thought and every discipline, including martial arts.</p>
    <p>The original conception of Tao was simply the observation that reality has a certain way about it. This “way” encompasses all of existence: life, the universe, and everything. A Christian may call it God’s will; an atheist may call it the laws of nature. These are labels pointing to the same thing, and Tao is simply the most generalized label imaginable, applicable to both perspectives.</p>
    <p>Because of the Tao’s inclusive nature, when Buddhism entered China 1,800 years ago, it found easy acceptance despite its differences from Taoism. A sense of optimism and humor runs throughout the ancient Tao, aptly expressed as “carefree wandering.” Buddhism, on the other hand, saw life as <i>ku hai</i>, the bitter ocean, and focused on suffering. Despite this, Chinese people regarded Buddhist teachings as simply another way to express the Tao, thus setting the stage for Religious Taoism and Buddhism to interact and influence one another. By the time the Indian monk Bodhidharma visited China several hundred years later, it was only natural that a fusion of Indian and Chinese thought would give rise to Zen Buddhism.</p>
    <p>This inclusive and unifying aspect of the Tao is something that is still not well understood in the West, and can lead to confusion about the similarities and differences between Taoism and Buddhism. It can also lead to an idea expressed by some Western authors that Taoism is opposed to another prominent Chinese tradition, Confucianism, which—contrasted to Taoism—is a philosophical framework on the interrelated functions of the individual and society, almost entirely devoid of spiritual commentary. While this confrontational model may be easy to grasp from a perspective that sees life in terms of battling forces, it is definitely not how the ancient sages viewed the Tao. To them, the Tao was a paradigm that encompassed everything. Although Religious Taoism did compete against Confucianism for the official designation as the philosophical basis of the empire, Chinese people throughout the centuries have been very comfortable subscribing to both camps, seeing them as complementary to one another, each useful in its own way.</p>
    <p>In the West, the Tao has veered away from its generic roots and taken on an aura of exotic mystique. Those of us who cling to this misconception may be surprised to encounter Asians who casually speak of the Tao of Jesus or the Tao of science. On the other hand, if we connect with the original meaning, we will see that the Tao is truly for everyone, regardless of religious orientation—or lack thereof.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, understanding the Tao helps remove us from a frame of mind that demands strict dualistic, either-or categories. To a mind that works in such dualisms, the question “Do you believe in God?” may be perfectly sensible. Yet, from the all-encompassing Taoist point of view, asking “Do you believe in the Tao?” makes as much sense as “Do you believe in your height?” Everyone has a certain height; this is something not subject to belief or disbelief. Similarly, everyone has a particular way—a uniquely individual outlook on life—and there is nothing we can do to affirm or deny it. Therefore, no one has to abandon or compromise his or her faith in order to “believe” in the Tao. Your Tao has always been and will always be a part of you.</p>
    <p>In this all-inclusive sense, every one of us is already on a path of some sort, so we are all travelers on the Tao. Those of us who become aware of this and actively seek further understanding by studying the ancient Chinese sages are part of a more specialized group. We are not necessarily Taoists in the religious sense, but we cultivate the Tao in our lives, so the term <i>Tao cultivator</i> can be an appropriate designation. Membership in this group requires nothing more than an active interest in the Tao; by picking up this book you have already made yourself part of this time-honored tradition.</p>
    <p>One characteristic of Tao cultivators is the understanding that the Tao does not have to be personified. It is the Ultimate Principle, not a supernatural being with human traits. Therefore, using a flame—a manifestation of energy—to represent it is better than using a painting or a sculpture of some human likeness. This is why the Mu Light is on the cover of this book. <i>Mu</i> is a reference to the nurturing nature of the Tao; <i>Light</i> represents divinity. The inscription behind the flame reads <i>wu ji,</i> meaning “without boundaries” and referring to the infinity of existence. When lit, the Mu Light casts its shadows through the inscription, symbolizing the way reality reflects the patterns of the Great Tao.</p>
    <h4>Ultimate Purpose</h4>
    <p>The ultimate purpose of the Tao Te Ching is to provide us with wisdom and insights that we can apply to life. If we cannot do that, then it doesn’t matter how well we understand the passages. The true Tao must be lived.</p>
    <p>At the cosmic level, the Tao of the macrocosm is represented by the laws of physics. They describe the universe and its manifestations, such as light, electricity, gravity, and so on. These things exist and have real effects no matter what we think of them. The gravity of the sun exerts its pull on the planets whether we “believe” in it or not.</p>
    <p>At the personal level, the Tao of the microcosm is no less descriptive and useful. Its principles describe the human sphere and its manifestations, such as love, hate, peace, violence, and so on. These principles are just as real as the laws of physics; they function just as predictably and inexorably regardless of our opinions.</p>
    <p>Lao Tzu’s purpose is to illustrate these principles. If we can understand interpersonal forces among people as clearly as we understand interplanetary forces among heavenly bodies, then we, too, can glide through life as effortlessly and precisely as spacecraft flying through the solar system. The ultimate worth of any translation depends on how well it achieves Lao Tzu’s purpose.</p>
    <p>In the West, study of the Tao has led to mixed results. Generally speaking, people understand the all-encompassing, freewheeling nature of the Tao quite well, but they do not connect as easily with Lao Tzu’s guidelines about life that require sustained effort. The result is that many who study the Tao end up with a form of relativism—thinking that because the Tao includes everything, whatever they do is already part of the Tao. Thus the Tao becomes the justification for any actions, positive or negative, as well as the all-purpose excuse for any results, or the lack thereof. This was never the original intent of the Tao Te Ching.</p>
    <p>The truth is that the Tao isn’t just about freedom and personal liberty; it is also about discipline and diligence. While everything in existence is indeed the Tao, our path through existence is also the Tao. This may seem like a paradox, but it really isn’t. We can see it clearly by following the thought process of the sages. Think of existence as a forest. When we are in the forest, we have the ability to go forth in any direction. The forest doesn’t care which path we take. It is the nature of the forest to offer all directions and all possibilities. This is <i>the way of the forest</i>—in other words, <i>the Tao of existence</i>.</p>
    <p>We can wander in the forest aimlessly for as long as we wish, but at a certain point some of us will be ready to choose a destination and go there. This destination may represent enlightenment, salvation, true happiness, or other spiritual goals. Let us think of the destination as a mountain that we, walking in the forest, can glimpse through the tree branches from time to time.</p>
    <p>There are paths in the forest that will take us to the mountain. These paths are easy to traverse and are marked by those who went before us. Inexperienced travelers may not be able to recognize the markings, but the Tao Te Ching is a map that can help us. When we follow the map, we move in a particular direction with a particular purpose. The progress we make is <i>our way through the forest</i>—in other words, <i>our Tao through existence</i>.</p>
    <p>Thus, the Tao indeed encompasses all, just as we have the freedom to pick any direction in the forest and start walking. At the same time, our Tao must also be highly specific, just as we must choose one path out of many in the forest with care and foresight, if we wish to get somewhere and achieve our purpose in life, whatever that purpose may be. Therefore, this book’s most important mission is to express the Tao <i>completely</i> as much as words can, conveying not only the encompassing aspect of the Tao but also its specific nature. To miss either attribute would be to fail the mission.</p>
    <p>Let us keep the forest and the mountain in mind as we digest each chapter. Where are you in life? Where are you going? These are some of the most important questions we can ask ourselves. The more we understand what Lao Tzu says, the more clearly we will be able to see the markings that direct us to the proven path. We will then be able to formulate better answers and take steps in the direction that will lead us to our goal.</p>
    <p>What will happen when we reach the summit? We will look around and take in the magnificent, panoramic view. From the vantage point at the top, we will be able to see other mountains in the hazy distance. We may rest for a bit; we may spend a moment in celebration. Then, we will start out for the next destination, savoring every breath of fresh air and every sight of natural beauty.</p>
    <p>As Lao Tzu remarks in chapter 64, the journey of a thousand miles begins beneath your feet. As you embark on this journey, I wish you happy trails.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter">A Note on the Translation</h2>
    <h4>Test of Time</h4>
    <p>In 2004, the College Board surveyed high schools to gauge interest in Advanced Placement courses in Chinese. The College Board expected a few hundred schools to express interest. What they found was substantially more: 2,400, or about ten times the level of interest they expected.</p>
    <p>As East and West continue to draw together, the language barrier will diminish. The more this process continues, the more people will be able to assess Tao Te Ching translations for themselves, and demand ever higher levels of quality and fidelity to the original Chinese. I believe this is inevitable, and I want this book to be the one that withstands the test of time. No matter how rigorous the standard, this translation you hold in your hands will meet and surpass it.</p>
    <h4>My Approach</h4>
    <p>When I began translating the Tao Te Ching, I quickly realized that I needed a plan to avoid potential pitfalls and ensure as much accuracy and authenticity as possible. None of the commercially available translations withstood scrutiny. If I wished to produce a different result, I should try an approach not previously taken. Over time, I settled on the following four methods:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Start from scratch and create an entirely original work. I could not use existing translations as references because they were not sufficiently accurate. Any similarity between this translation and others would be purely coincidental.</p></li>
        <li><p>Overcome the English-Chinese language barrier by bringing native fluency of both languages to the project. This alone would address many issues, since nearly all Tao Te Ching translators possess unbalanced levels of language proficiency.</p></li>
        <li><p>Reference Chinese commentaries. The unbroken tradition of Tao Te Ching teachings began two thousand years ago and has continued to the present time. Although no living person can claim to possess native fluency in ancient Chinese, the commentaries give us the next best thing. They are like a window to the past.</p></li>
        <li><p>Consult the ultimate experts on the Tao. I was fortunate in having access to Taoist masters from the I-Kuan Tao lineage. Their knowledge of the Tao comes from lifelong study as well as practical application. I drew upon their knowledge to make my presentation of the Tao as authentic as possible; I also followed their example in putting the Tao to the test, to verify its truth through actual usage.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>As I followed this plan, I continued to compare my work in progress with existing translations and noticed an additional problem common to them all: a tendency to blur the line between translation and interpretation. A literal translation (also known as formal equivalence) is the nearest linguistic equivalent between the source and target language, while an interpretation (also known as dynamic equivalence) consists of amplifications and clarifications, and so contains a lot more of the translator’s personal opinions. Existing translations tended to present interpretations as translations.</p>
    <p>Much of this was due to format. Most editions included few or no annotations or explanations, so the translator perhaps felt compelled to explain the original within the translation itself. This process necessarily engaged the translator’s understanding. Thus, what might have started out as a literal translation got twisted more and more into an expression of the translator’s thoughts.</p>
    <p>This is why the volume you now hold in your hands is so revolutionary. Its format allows for an extremely faithful rendition of the original that adds nothing and subtracts nothing, while providing explanations on the opposite page, clearly marked as such. With this format, I can preserve the original and still clarify its meaning, and you will never have to wonder whether some particular words come from Lao Tzu or from me. The difference between the two will be unmistakable, so you can judge the interpretation for yourself.</p>
    <h4>Pronunciation and Romanization</h4>
    <p>One of the first specific challenges I had to address in creating a new translation concerned how to spell words in English to reflect their pronunciation in Chinese. For example, although <i>Tao</i> is traditionally spelled with the letter <i>t</i>, it is meant to be pronounced with the <i>d</i> sound, like <i>Dow</i> in Dow Jones. Similarly, <i>Tao Te Ching</i> should be pronounced like <i>Dao De Jing</i>. There are other terms in the study of the Tao that do not sound like the way they look. This is the result of romanization—the transliteration of Chinese characters using English letters—and it can be confusing.</p>
    <p>The first Chinese romanization system was Wade-Giles, created about a hundred years ago. The earliest Western scholars who studied Chinese had neither prior work to guide them nor significant assistance from native speakers. Their system required specialized knowledge to use correctly, but that knowledge remained trapped in academic obscurity and never made it out to the mainstream. Confusion about this system is so pervasive that, even today, many who claim expertise about the Tao continue to mispronounce or misspell Chinese words. Even the Chinese themselves get confused, despite knowing how their own language sounds. They have, in effect, adopted Western mistakes as their own.</p>
    <p>In an attempt to address this issue, Chinese scholars have created a new standard to replace Wade-Giles: the Pinyin system. This new standard resolves the problems highlighted above but introduces new ones. For instance, Pinyin’s use of the letters <i>x</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>q</i> can be misleading to most English speakers. It is also likely that problems will worsen as people liberally mix the two systems without really understanding either one.</p>
    <p>In this book, I deal with this confusing situation by using the following three guidelines:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>If a term romanized with Wade-Giles is already well known, it will remain unchanged, to conform with the common, established usage.</p></li>
        <li><p>If a term is not well known, it will be romanized with the Pinyin system to conform to the new standard established by mainland China for the future.</p></li>
        <li><p>Wherever either system produces confusing results, pronunciation assistance will be provided parenthetically.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Holistic Understanding</h4>
    <p>Another challenge I faced in creating the most accurate translation possible has to do with the Chinese language itself, which has evolved a lot over the centuries. Many ancient characters are no longer in modern usage, and some characters have taken on new meanings. The syntax has also changed so that native speakers of modern Chinese can find the ancient form quite baffling. All of this can lead to misunderstanding. The best way to avoid this misunderstanding is to approach the Tao Te Ching as a whole and use the entire book to help us understand individual chapters.</p>
    <p>One example to illustrate this comes from line 3 of chapter 1. It starts with the characters <i>wu ming</i>, which mean “not having” and “name” respectively. Together, they can be translated as “nameless.” Thus, the entire line means “The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth.” This is the classical interpretation. Another school of thought is that there should be a pause after <i>wu</i>, thus making it a noun instead of an adjective. The translation then becomes “The state of nonexistence is the name for the origin of Heaven and Earth” or “Nonexistence is named the origin of Heaven and Earth.” Scholars who support this new interpretation feel that it makes more sense.</p>
    <p>The concept of punctuation marks is unknown in ancient Chinese, so there may or may not be a pause after <i>wu</i>. If we cannot tell one way or the other, does that mean both interpretations are equally valid? Not necessarily. We can distinguish between the two by checking other chapters of the Tao Te Ching. If <i>wu ming</i> is clearly used to say “nameless” in other chapters, then the classical interpretation is more likely to be correct. On the other hand, if other chapters show <i>ming</i> being used in the same way as the new interpretation, then that would give credence to the new interpretation.</p>
    <p>Chapters 32, 37, and 41 all feature the use of <i>wu ming</i>. In these chapters, <i>wu ming</i> can only be translated as “nameless,” due to unambiguous context. This is a powerful endorsement of the classical interpretation. Chapter 14 demonstrates that when Lao Tzu uses <i>ming</i> in the way suggested by the new interpretation, he adds the character <i>yue</i> to remove the ambiguity. Because the <i>yue</i> character cannot be found anywhere in chapter 1, this becomes evidence against the new interpretation.</p>
    <p>This example illustrates how tricky it can be for us to approach the Tao Te Ching. It also underlines the importance of reading the entire book as an integrated whole, so we can see the common threads from various chapters and how they reinforce one another. This approach is the way to go if we wish to understand Lao Tzu’s teachings as clearly as possible.</p>
    <h4>The Language Barrier</h4>
    <p>Even with these strategies in place, however, I still had to deal with the fundamental barrier between Chinese and English. Chinese comes from linguistic roots that are entirely different from those of European languages, and rendering an understandable yet accurate translation can be difficult to achieve. Specifically, I wanted to pay special attention to vocabularly and word choice to avoid the errors common to many other translations of the Tao Te Ching.</p>
    <p>Few translators possess native command of both languages, and the result is the greatly varying quality of translations available today. Inaccurate translations do a disservice to the reader because they may distort the original meaning or even obscure it completely. We may end up with something that bears little resemblance to the original, genuine wisdom—and we may not be aware of what we are missing. Chapter 46 is an example of this. It starts with the image of fast horses, formerly used by the army for scouting missions, being retired to till the fields. This is the ancient Chinese equivalent of beating swords into plowshares, as well as a deft depiction of peace and harmony. Lao Tzu then contrasts it with the description of a pregnant mare being forced to give birth in the middle of the battlefield—a singularly powerful image that evokes the misery and horrors of war.</p>
    <p>What happens when this chapter goes through the translation process? In one popular version, all references to horses have disappeared, replaced by factories, trucks, tractors, warheads, and cities. None of these things can be found in the original text, and—obviously—none of them existed in ancient China. This creative license is clearly an interpretation, not a translation. Even more important, it denies the reader the beauty and power of the original vision.</p>
    <p>Sometimes translators may guess at the meaning of a character without consulting a dictionary. For instance, some have rendered the first line of the Tao Te Ching as “the path that can be trodden,” guessing that <i>dao,</i> the character for the Tao or the path, should mean “to walk” when used as a verb. Some scholars also assert that this is the original meaning, which differs from modern usage. However, there is no compelling evidence to support this assertion, and it contradicts virtually all Chinese commentaries on chapter 1.</p>
    <p>When used as a verb, <i>dao</i> can only mean “to speak, to talk, to discuss.” Walking simply isn’t one of the definitions. Therefore, to translate the first line as “the path that can be trodden” is like saying “I am waying” in English when you really mean “I am walking.” This is not a valid usage because “way” doesn’t have that meaning. It is the same with <i>dao</i>.</p>
    <p>Another example of distortion is the “uncarved block,” a concept that everyone studying the Tao will come across sooner or later. It is a reference to <i>pu</i>, the Taoist principle of simplicity. The uncarved block refers to things in their original, primal state, filled with the inherent power of potential and possibilities, before that power is lost to human contrivance as the block is carved into a specific form.</p>
    <p>In modern Chinese, <i>pu</i> means “plain.” In ancient Chinese, it can also mean “plain wood.” Either way, the meaning of <i>pu</i> does not include a block of any sort. Thus, “uncarved block” is actually a mistranslation. Plain wood represents the original state of simplicity far better than the uncarved block. A plain piece of wood may be found in nature, completely untouched by human hands. The uncarved block, on the other hand, has already been worked on—someone had to cut a plain piece of wood in order to get a block out of it. Therefore, “uncarved block” is more than just a mistranslation. It is also an obstruction to those who seek the authentic teaching.</p>
    <h4>Translation Techniques</h4>
    <p>Ultimately, my translation was an iterative process in which I took each semantic unit (a character, a word, or an expression) from the original text and searched for the best approximation in English. This search yielded results that fell into one of three possible categories.</p>
    <p>The first category consists of words that have been formally accepted into the English language and show up in mainstream dictionaries. They should be used in a translation whenever possible for maximum accuracy. <i>Tao, chi, yin</i>, and <i>yang</i> are good examples. Not many words enjoy this level of acceptance, so this category remains sparse. Prior to <i>Tao</i> becoming an English word, it was acceptable to translate <i>dao</i> as “the Way.” Now that Tao is part of our language, “the Way” can no longer be considered the optimal translation.</p>
    <p>The second category consists of expressions that have a direct English equivalent. For instance, <i>tian di</i> means “Heaven and Earth,” an expression that already exists in English, so <i>tian di</i> can be translated literally. Another example is <i>tian xia</i> (pronounced <i>shia</i>), which literally means “below heaven” or “under the sky.” It can be translated as it is, except when the usage clearly means “the world.”</p>
    <p>The character <i>te</i> corresponds with the word <i>virtue</i> in a serendipitous way. Virtue means not only a human goodness (compassion, patience, generosity, etc.) but also an inherent power in all things. For instance, when we say “by virtue of being there, he witnessed the event” we are not saying “being there” is a positive human trait. We are saying that “being there” has an inherent power that enables what follows. <i>Te</i> has the same dual meaning, so it should therefore be mapped to “virtue” whenever possible. Some translators use “integrity,” which loses the value of this correspondence.</p>
    <p>The nearest equivalent to the character <i>ching</i> (pronounced <i>jing</i>) is “tome” or “classic.” The widely used convention is “book,” which has a different feel but is still acceptable. Therefore, a reasonable translation for Tao Te Ching is “Book of the Tao and Virtue.” This is more accurate than “Book of the Way and Its Virtue” or “Book of the Tao and Its Power.”</p>
    <p>The third category consists of expressions that have no direct English equivalents and must be translated by meaning. For instance, <i>wu wei,</i> although well known to students of the Tao, has not yet made it into the English language. It cannot be left as it is in the translation, nor should it be translated into a misleading term such as “nonaction” or “without doing.” The closest linguistic equivalent to <i>wu wei</i> is “detached action,” or “acting without attachment.”</p>
    <p>Another prominent example in this category is <i>wan wu</i>, which literally means “ten thousand things.” At the present time, “ten thousand things” exists in English as Taoist jargon; it is not part of the popular vernacular. Therefore, it should not be translated literally. The nearest linguistic equivalent to <i>wan wu</i> is “myriad things” or “all things.”</p>
    <p>Similarly, <i>shen ren</i> means “divine person”—someone so wise that his or her wisdom approaches the Divine. Several past attempts to translate this have yielded poor results. For instance, “holy man” and “saint” both carry religious connotations not found in the original. Another attempt, “evolved individual,” carries the context of spiritual evolution, which is really a pet notion injected by the translator. The term “sage” is much closer to the original. (Other examples in this category, such as <i>chien li</i> and <i>bai xing</i>, can best be explained fully on the www.taoism.net website. The site offers a wealth of material specifically designed to complement this book. Please see Suggestions for Further Reading for additional details.)</p>
    <p>A final piece of my translation work had to do with the use of punctuation. Although the concept of punctuation marks did not exist in ancient Chinese, the language did have its own specific ways of denoting various effects of speech. For example, a larger than usual gap between characters meant a slight pause, equivalent to a comma. Special characters at the end of a sentence served the same functions as the period, question mark, and exclamation point. These special characters are no longer used in modern Chinese, which has adopted a set of punctuation marks similar to punctuation used in English. In my translation, however, I wanted to approximate the open, porous feel of ancient Chinese—the native tongue of the Tao Te Ching—so I chose to omit periods and most other punctuation except where necessary for clarity.</p>
    <p>The net effect of all these techniques is a translation that tunes in to the Tao Te Ching with maximum fidelity and minimum static. I understand that not everyone places as much importance on this as I do; at the same time, my opinion is that a translation for a sacred text should be a mirror that reflects the original as perfectly as possible. Warped mirrors may be amusing for the funhouse, but they are not so great for daily use, which is the ultimate goal of the Tao Te Ching—to be both an inspiration and a practical guide to your path through this life.</p>
